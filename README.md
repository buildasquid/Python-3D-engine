# Python-3D-engine
A rudimentary 3D engine to view meshes in.

You can either add various 3D objects like a cube by specifying its vertices or you can add objects by "importing" an .obj file. 
Its polycount has to be very low though.

Added the ability to move and rotate the camera and the object (if only one object is in the scene).
